# @shashwatgtmalpha/craft-content-mcp v2.0.0

🎯 **CRAFT Content Framework MCP Server** - Complete redesign with user-centric inputs, actual content analysis, and publish-ready outputs.

## Design Philosophy

Every tool was redesigned using **chain of thought from the user's perspective**:

1. **What does the user actually want?** (Not what looks impressive in a demo)
2. **What do they already know?** (Keep inputs simple - don't ask for things they need to figure out)
3. **Does the output save them work?** (Publish-ready, not templates to fill)

## What's New in v2.0.0

| Tool | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| **thought_leadership_series** | 🔴 200-300 word posts with `[Expand]` placeholders | ✅ **600-800 word byline articles** ready for publication |
| **craft_content_improver** | 🔴 Blank scorecard output | ✅ **Actually analyzes** content, scores dimensions, generates improved version |
| **case_study_generator** | 🟡 Requires full story | ✅ **Discovery mode** - generates interview questions if you don't have the story |
| **sales_enablement_content** | 🟡 Generic pitches | ✅ **Objection-mapped handlers** with specific proof points |
| newsletter_builder | 🟢 Good | ✅ Enhanced with A/B subject lines, 4 hooks, segment targeting |
| webinar_script | 🟢 Good | ✅ Type-specific structures (demo vs educational vs panel) |
| content_repurposer | 🟢 Excellent | ✅ Kept - transforms to 10+ formats |
| testimonial_capture | 🟢 Excellent | ✅ Kept - request emails, interview guides |

## Input Design Principles

1. **Only ask for what users actually know** - Don't require "value propositions" if they're calling because they haven't articulated them yet
2. **Make required inputs minimal** - 3-4 required, rest optional with smart defaults
3. **Use natural language** - "your_take" not "contrarian_perspective_thesis"
4. **Derive what you can** - If user gives topic, auto-generate related elements

## Output Design Principles

1. **Publish-ready** - No `[Fill in]` or `[Expand]` placeholders
2. **Right length for the format** - Bylines = 600-800 words, Social posts = 200-300 words
3. **Include metadata** - Word counts, posting times, headlines
4. **Add promotional content** - Social snippets to promote longer content
